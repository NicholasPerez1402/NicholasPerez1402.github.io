### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    I really enjoyed doing lab 1, part 1 as it was our first time applying the things I was learning in my lecture class. Since this is my first time doing a Computer Science lecture class and really learning Computer Science i wanted to add lab 1 because it was my first ever project. The start of my Computer Science career!

* Lab 5

    I enjoyed doing part 1 of lab 5 because while it was simple in its calculations and what we were calculating, it was fun to be able to see the number work together to give us the answers we desired. Creating the code to allow the math to correctly perform the numbers being imputed was really cool to do. While lab 5 was not my most favorite, it had to be top 3 for how it showed me how mathematically things can be calculated using code and logical operands! 

* Lab 7

    My favorite part of lab 7 was part 2. The reason for this is because Iâ€™ve played black jack alot with family and friends and is definitely my go to whenever a card game is mentioned or a group of people come together to play some games. Seeing how to create a game that I play alot was definitely a fun experience in itself.
